# Codebase Concerns Template

Template for `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` - captures known issues and areas requiring care.

**Purpose:** Surface actionable warnings about the codebase. Focused on "what to watch out for when making changes."

## Scaling Limits

**[Resource/System]:**
- Current capacity: [Numbers: "100 req/sec", "10k users"]
- Limit: [Where it breaks]
- Symptoms at limit: [What happens]

## Dependencies at Risk

**[Package/Service]:**
- Risk: [e.g., "deprecated", "unmaintained", "breaking changes coming"]
- Impact: [What breaks if it fails]
- Migration plan: [Alternative or upgrade path]

## Missing Critical Features

**[Feature gap]:**
- Problem: [What's missing]
- Current workaround: [How users cope]
- Blocks: [What can't be done without it]
- Implementation complexity: [Rough effort estimate]

## Test Coverage Gaps

**[Untested area]:**
- What's not tested: [Specific functionality]
- Risk: [What could break unnoticed]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
- Difficulty to test: [Why it's not tested yet]

<good_examples>
Example entries (condensed):

**Tech Debt:** "Direct Supabase queries in 15+ components" — Files: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (and 11 more). Impact: Can't implement RLS. Fix: Move to server actions.

**Known Bug:** "Race condition in subscription updates" — Symptoms: User shows "free" for 5-10s after payment. Trigger: Fast navigation after Stripe redirect. Root cause: Webhook slower than navigation.

**Security:** "Admin role check client-side only" — Risk: No server verification for admin pages. Recommendation: Add middleware in `middleware.ts`.

**Performance:** "/api/courses endpoint" — 1.2s p95, N+1 query pattern. Fix: Prisma eager-load + Redis cache.

**Fragile:** "Auth middleware chain" — 4 functions in specific order, order change breaks everything, no integration tests.

**Scaling:** "Supabase Free Tier" — 500MB DB, ~5000 users limit, 429 errors at limit, upgrade to Pro.
</good_examples>

<guidelines>
**What belongs in CONCERNS.md:**
- Tech debt with clear impact and fix approach
- Known bugs with reproduction steps
- Security gaps and mitigation recommendations
- Performance bottlenecks with measurements
- Fragile code that breaks easily
- Scaling limits with numbers
- Dependencies that need attention
- Missing features that block workflows
- Test coverage gaps

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Opinions without evidence ("code is messy")
- Complaints without solutions ("auth sucks")
- Future feature ideas (that's for product planning)
- Normal TODOs (those live in code comments)
- Architectural decisions that are working fine
- Minor code style issues

**When filling this template:**
- **Always include file paths** - Concerns without locations are not actionable. Use backticks: `src/file.ts`
- Be specific with measurements ("500ms p95" not "slow")
- Include reproduction steps for bugs
- Suggest fix approaches, not just problems
- Focus on actionable items
- Prioritize by risk/impact
- Update as issues get resolved
- Add new concerns as discovered

**Tone guidelines:**
- Professional, not emotional ("N+1 query pattern" not "terrible queries")
- Solution-oriented ("Fix: add index" not "needs fixing")
- Risk-focused ("Could expose user data" not "security is bad")
- Factual ("3.5s load time" not "really slow")

**Useful for phase planning when:**
- Deciding what to work on next
- Estimating risk of changes
- Understanding where to be careful
- Prioritizing improvements
- Onboarding new Claude contexts
- Planning refactoring work

**How this gets populated:**
Explore agents detect these during codebase mapping. Manual additions welcome for human-discovered issues. This is living documentation, not a complaint list.
